        "## 1.1. The Way of the Program\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called, The Way of the Program.\n",
        "\n",
        "On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.2. Algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "If problem solving is a central part of computer science, then the solutions that you create through the problem solving process are also important. In computer science, we refer to these solutions as algorithms. An algorithm is a step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal in computer science is to take a problem and develop an algorithm that can serve as a general solution. Once we have such a solution, we can use our computer to automate the execution. As noted above, programming is a skill that allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent it in a notation (a program) that can be followed by a computer. These programs are written in programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.3. The Python Programming Language\n",
        "\n",
        "The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example\n",
        "of a __high-level language__; other high-level languages you might have heard\n",
        "of are C++, PHP, and Java.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also __low-level languages__, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Machine language is the encoding of instructions in binary so that they can be directly executed by the computer.  Assembly language uses a slightly easier format to refer to the low level instructions.  Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages.  To be exact, computers can actually only execute programs written in machine language. Thus, programs written in a high-level language (and even those in assembly language) have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be\n",
        "correct. Second, high-level languages are __portable__, meaning that they can\n",
        "run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level\n",
        "programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run\n",
        "on another.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level\n",
        "languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized\n",
        "applications.\n",
        "  \n",
        "<p>Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages:\n",
        "__interpreters__ and __compilers__. An interpreter reads a high-level program\n",
        "and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the\n",
        "program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing\n",
        "computations.\n",
        "<img alt=\"Interpret illustration\" src=\"../_images/interpret.png\" />\n",
        "<p>A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program\n",
        "starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the __source\n",
        "code__, and the translated program is called the __object code__ or the\n",
        "__executable__. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly\n",
        "without further translation.\n",
        "  \n",
        "<img alt=\"Compile illustration\" src=\"../_images/compile.png\" />\n",

        "a __virtual machine__. Python uses both processes, but because of the way\n",
        "programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.\n",
        "  \n",
        "<p>There are two ways to use the Python interpreter: <em>shell mode</em> and <em>program\n",
